# maldns
maldns uses the permutation functions from altdns to generate possible subdomains

This tool was developed to fit a specific task I need for my Bug Bounty Recon Pipeline, and is in no way a replacement for 'altdns'.  I simply removed the DNS resolution functionality from 'altdns' and updated the permutations logic to use python 3.8+ with some minor function modifications.
